# ECommerceAPI
An Ecommerce API that helps to process every task an e-commerce application should be able to do

## Implemenatation
1. I learnt Mapping of Models(Schemas) with DTOs(Data Transfer Objects)
2. I Worked on increasing the performance of the API for efficiency using in-memory caching.

## Tools
* C#(.NET)
* PostgreSQL
* EFCore
* asynchronous operations(async & await).

## Milestone
* I was able to create a secure, robust and efficient API which does the necessary operations in order to aid a functional application.
